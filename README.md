# sort

## Problem

Given: Two lists of integers, for example, L1 and L2;
Output: The largest number in L1 which does not in L2, and output a "NOUN" if don't exists.

## Details

In the file, each list contains of a sequence lines of positive integers, with a line containing a 0 delimiting the two lists.

l1 to l11 files are sample integers.

The algorithm is a conbination of both heap and queue method.
The algorithm will sort the list to find the largest number, find the target number by compare to the largest number

## Sample Output

Here are some file you can use for testing.
  1. l1 (Answer: 5)
  2. l2 (Answer: NONE)
  3. l3 (Answer: NONE)
  4. l4 (Answer: NONE)
  5. l5 (Answer: 923095723)
  6. l6 (Answer: 50000)
  7. l7 (Answer: 78)
  8. l8 (Answer: NONE)
  9. l9 (Answer: 199)
  10. l10 (Answer: 2147483647)
  11. l11 (Answer: 2147483640)
